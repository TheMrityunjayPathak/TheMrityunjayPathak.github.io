**Font Awesome**
- I use Font Awesome icons to make the website more interactive and dynamic.
- Icons paired with text make buttons, links and sections easier to understand.
- They give a visual sense for actions like Email, GitHub, or Social links.
- They can react with hover effects or animations, making the website feel alive.
- Also easy to customize size, colors and style to match the website theme.
